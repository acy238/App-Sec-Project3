The database migration and seeding were split into two separate jobs; hence, two separate yaml files were created.
  1. db-part-two-migrate.yaml for migrations
  2. db-part-two-seed.yaml for seeding 
  
The sql code used in both yaml files were part of the "setup.sql" file.
However, the migrations and seeding actions were split into two separate sql files:
  1. migrate.sql for migrations
  2. seed.sql for seeding
Note that both sql files were included in the "db/Dockerfile" to be copied over with the "COPY" command. 
These two sql files are now available for their respective yaml files.

The job of migration and seeding can now be performed from the command line with these commands:
-> kubectl apply -f db/k8/db-part-two-migrate.yaml
-> kubectl apply -f db/k8/db-part-two-seed.yaml
