On the kubernetes website, it mentions: 
"Storing confidential information in a Secret is safer and more flexible than putting it verbatim in a Pod definition or in a container image."

For this reason, we placed the value of "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" within a "secret" for these two following deployments:
  1. GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
  2. db/k8/db-deployment.yaml
  
The file names for the secrets are titled: "django-MYSQL-ROOT-PASSWORD.yaml" and "db-MYSQL-ROOT-PASSWORD.yaml", respectively.
  These files are detailed here for readability and for your convenience.
  In practice, respective secrets' yaml files would not be uploaded to their source code repos.
The files are located within their respective k8 folder/directory.
The secrets are accessible as environment variables.
