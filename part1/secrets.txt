On the kubernetes website, it mentions: 
"Storing confidential information in a Secret is safer and more flexible than putting it verbatim in a Pod definition or in a container image."

For this reason, we placed the value of "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" within a "secret" for these two following deployments:
  1. GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
  2. db/k8/db-deployment.yaml
  
The file names for the secrets are titled: "django-MYSQL-ROOT-PASSWORD.yaml" and "db-MYSQL-ROOT-PASSWORD.yaml", respectively.
  These files are detailed here for readability and for your convenience.
  In practice, respective secrets' yaml files would not be uploaded to their source code repos.
  The files are located within their respective k8 folder/directory.
The secrets are accessible as environment variables to the containers, rather than having sensitive information directly coded in.

The Django secret key has been replaced with a kubernetes secret, environment variable named: "SECRET_KEY".
  An extra data point was included in: django-admin-pass-secret.yaml, with this code on the last line:
  -> secretkey: kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l
This extra data point was included in "django-deploy.yaml", with the environment variable name "SECRET_KEY".
Within the other file, the "settings.py" file for Django, we replaced the original "SECRET_KEY" variable with this code below at line #25:
-> SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
